description: In 2021, I wrote my Bachelor thesis on 'Prototypical Development of Interactive and High-Performance Web Components for Data Visualization with CSS Houdini'. As part of this project, I developed a prototype charting library called 'Houdini Charts'. The library featured two chart types, a line chart and a radar chart. Given the prominence of COVID-19 at that time, I used coronavirus case data from the Robert Koch Institute as the basis for my charts.
