description: The R.Y.N.O Hoverboard is a concept asset I made for the game Ratchet & Clank. It's a tribute to one of the game's coolest weapons. I made it using Blender and Substance Painter. It was a fun project where I learned a lot about computer graphics. Check it out and feel the excitement of Ratchet & Clank brought to life!
