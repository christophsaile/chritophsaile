description: I started this project to challenge myself to learn different techniques in Photoshop. With 'Lucid Dreams,' I wanted to blend photography with digital art. The idea was to capture the essence of exploring one's dreams. I snapped some photos to use as my base and then got to work in Photoshop, tweaking, distorting, and blending until reality melted into fantasy. In the end, 'Lucid Dreams' became a testament to my journey with Photoshop, showing how imagination and a bit of digital magic can create something truly mesmerizing.
