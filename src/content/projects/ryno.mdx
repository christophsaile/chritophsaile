description: The R.Y.N.O Hoverboard is a concept asset I created for the game Ratchet & Clank. Ratchet & Clank was the first game I played on the PlayStation 2 in 2002, and I've been a fan of the series ever since. I was particularly excited by the hoverboard races back then, so it was a natural choice for me to create a new hoverboard as an asset for the game. The name R.Y.N.O is a tribute to strongest weapon of the game. I made this project using Blender and Substance Painter. It was a very fun project where I learned a lot about computer graphics. The created asset is designed to fit into the game look of the Ratchet & Clank remake, which was released on the PlayStation 4 in 2016. Check it out!
