      Building KÃ¤sediebe, my food blog, required a combination of technologies
      and infrastructure to ensure a seamless and efficient user experience.
      Here's an overview of the tools and services that power the application:
      To expedite the development process, I utilized <a
        href='https://tailwindcss.com/'>Tailwind CSS</a
      > and <a href='https://daisyui.com/'>daisyUI</a>. These tools provided
      prebuilt components that allowed me to build my app efficiently without
      spending too much time on design details. As a static site generator,
      <a href='https://astro.build/'>Astro</a> plays a crucial role in my workflow.
      It enables me to quickly generate all the pages for my blog during build time,
      ensuring fast load times and a smooth user experience. For the interactive
      client-side components, I employed <a href='https://www.solidjs.com/'
        >SolidJS</a
      >, which allows me to create dynamic elements that enhance the overall
      functionality of the site. For content management, I chose <a
        href='https://www.contentful.com/'>Contentful</a
      >, a headless CMS that as a flawless integration with Astro. This
      combination makes maintaining my blog effortless and straightforward. I
      host my application on <a href='https://www.netlify.com/'>Netlify</a>,
      which provides reliable and efficient hosting services. To implement
      instant search functionality, I integrated <a
        href='https://www.algolia.com/'>Algolia</a
      >. It is directly connected to my Contentful space, ensuring that whenever
      I publish a new recipe, Contentful triggers a webhook. This webhook
      updates the Algolia search index and initiates a build and deployment of
      my app on Netlify, keeping everything up-to-date seamlessly.
